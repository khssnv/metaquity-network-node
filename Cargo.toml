# SBP-M1 review: as noted, the template used for this project is based on the `substrate-node-template` which is for building a solo chain rather than a parachain.
# SBP-M1 review: Cumulus (https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus) is the parachain SDK which should be used instead to build a parachain, with a starter template available at https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template
# SBP-M1 review: finally, the Extended Parachain Template (https://github.com/paritytech/extended-parachain-template) builds on the above and is recommended for a new parachain project.

# SBP-M1 review: add integration tests to ensure runtime functionality works as expected. Suggested tools include zombienet, parachains-integration-tests, chopsticks as applicable.
